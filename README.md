# Garbage Robot
## Overview 
The problem of plastic waste floating in rivers and lakes is increasing. This leads to water pollution or non-biodegradable plastic waste that will clog and cause loss of aesthetics. Therefore, our team's vision is to design and manufacture a robot that ***automatically*** moves along a route on water. It will be compact so it can be wriggled and collected.

Garbage Robot has a name that is Clync. It is a system for cleaning trash on water (rivers, lakes), operating in an autonomous manner that is set up based on where and when the user wants to clean.
