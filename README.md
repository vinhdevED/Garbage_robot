<h1 align="center">âš¡ Garbage Robot âš¡</h1>

## âœ‹ Overview 
The problem of plastic waste floating in rivers and lakes is increasing. This leads to water pollution or non-biodegradable plastic waste that will clog and cause loss of aesthetics. Therefore, our team's vision is to design and manufacture a robot that ***automatically*** moves along a route on water. It will be compact so it can be wriggled and collected.

Garbage Robot has a name that is Clync. It is a system for cleaning trash on water (rivers, lakes), operating in an autonomous manner that is set up based on where and when the user wants to clean.

## -Framework-
We use ***Flutter Framework*** for cross-platform application development for web/android/ios which helps in optimization and better UI development and stability. Express.js simplifies handling HTTP requests and routing management. It is used with ***NodeJS***.

## -Wireless Communication-
This device operates on water (lakes, rivers) so cannot use Bluetooth, Wifi, Zigbee and other short-range wireless communication technologies. Those types consume more energy so they are not suitable for the operating range of this device.

>LoRaWAN is a wireless communication technology used for wide-range IoT (Internet of Things) networks (LPWAN - Low-Power Wide-Area Network). LoRaWAN is one of the technologies that provides IoT device connectivity with low power consumption and can serve long communication distances.

>LoRaWAN technology uses the **LoRa (Long Range)** wireless communication protocol to connect IoT devices to network infrastructure through communication gateways.

We decided to choose ***LoRa*** as the primary wireless communication.

# Overview
It is a system that uses an automatic balancing module to prevent water drift. In addition, robots use AI to identify waste to pick up trash and move it.
